#### vimrc

I am in very begining of process of making VIM by everyday editor. Therefore,
the configuration currently is very basic and minimal

I refer to [ThoughtBot's
.vimrc](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles/blob/master/vimrc) file alot.

#### zshrc

I have recently install zsh and
[oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh). I refered to
[ThoughtBot's
zshrc](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles/tree/master/zsh/configs) for
some configuration
